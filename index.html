        Rock paper scissors is a hand game originating in China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
      </p>
      <p class="desc disappear" id="desc2">
        The rock is a closed fist; paper is a flat hand with fingers and thumb extended and the palm facing downward; and scissors is a fist with the index and middle fingers fully extended toward the opposing player. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.
